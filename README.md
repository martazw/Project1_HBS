When entering a new business, Microsoft has one tradition. Strive for excellence. Our goal with Microsoft Studio is to perpetuate this tradition.

Every year, thousands of new movies are released. Some are acclaimed by the critics; others are box office success. Our goal is to release movies that are both, critic and box office success. 
First, less take a look on this 2x2 matrice of all the movies that were released during the last 10 years.

We are using 2 metrics to evaluate the movies:
- the average rating on IMDB, only for movies with more than 50 ratings
- the Return on Investment (ROI), which is the wordlwide revenue generated by a movie divided by the movie's budget
We will focus our presentation on the upper right part of the cadran, movies that have a ROI over 5 and an average rating > 6.5






Our next graph aims at analyzing sesonality. We are trying to know what's the best month to release a movie 




Most successfull genre




Most succesfull actors




Most succesfull directors





Based on those 5 differents analysis, we have a sypnosis for our first movie.
It will be a Drama movie with a hinch of comedy, directed by James Wan and starring Michael B. Jordan and Emma Stone.
